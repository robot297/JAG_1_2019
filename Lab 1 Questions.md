## Lab 1


### 1. Miles from MCTC

Ask the user how many miles they live from MCTC.

Once the user has typed in their response,

*	Display "You live more than 10 miles from MCTC" if they live more than 10 miles away,
*	Display "You live exactly 10 miles from MCTC" if they live exactly 10 miles away,
*	Display "You live less than 10 miles from MCTC" if they live less than 10 miles away.

Use if – else if – else statements.

  
### 2. Quiz Question
       
Finish the checkAnswer method that correctly identifies if the answer to the quiz question is correct.

Hint: the answer is Bill Gates.
    
    
### 3. NASA Astronaut
 
To become a NASA astronaut, you need to be between 58 and 76 inches tall, so you
are not too tall to fit in the spaceship, but are tall enough to can reach all the controls.

You also need to be able to swim at least 75 yards when you make a water landing on return to earth.

Write a program to ask the user questions about their height and swimming ability,
and then use conditional statements to determine if they have potential as a NASA astronaut.

There are many ways of doing this too - once you've written and tested a solution,
can you think of another way of doing it? Make sure your tests still pass.


### 4. Mail Prices

USPS charges 49c to mail a standard, rectangular letter.

USPS charges an extra 21c to mail a non-machinable letter,
the type of letter that can't be processed by their mail-sorting machines.

Rectangular letters can be processed by machine. Square, circular or other shaped letters can't be processed by machine.
Letters must be flat to be processed by machine. Letters that are not flat (with bumps or have a curved shape) can't be processed by machine.

Write a letter mailing price calculating program.

Ask the user what shape their letter is - rectangular or not
Ask the user if their letter is flat or not

Calculate and display the cost to mail the letter.

  
### 5. Parcel Delivery

A parcel delivery company charges the following rates to ship a parcel.

*	Up to 10 pounds: $2.15 per pound
*	Up to 20 pounds: $1.55 per pound
*	Up to 30 pounds: $1.15 per pound

The shipping company does not ship parcels that weigh over 30 pounds.

So, a parcel that weighs 17 pounds will cost $1.55 x 17 = $26.35.

Write a program that asks the user for the weight of a parcel and displays whether it can be shipped, and what it will cost.

Optional extra: the most obvious solution to this problem uses if statements for the price bands. Can you think of a different way?  Hint:  loops, and arrays of price and max weights for price?


### 6. Windows 10 Upgrade

 To upgrade to Windows 10, a computer needs to have:

 •	Either Windows 7 OR Windows 8 installed   AND
 •	1 GHz or faster processor   AND
 •	2 GB or more RAM

 Write a program that asks the user for the current version of their
 operating system, the CPU speed, and amount of RAM.

 You will need to use && and || operator in conditions to display a message telling the user
 if they are able to install Windows 10.
 
 Tip: if your program is failing the tests, check page 74 of Think Java, and/or look up short circuit evaluation.
